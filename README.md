# My CTF challenge Writeups
 In this Repo I will catalogue my solutions for different CTF challenges I have completed.
 
 I'm a beginner interested in cybersecurity for fun and my own fun and this is a way for me to organize my solutions and hopefully help others.

## About Me
 My name is Leon and I'm an 18 year old Computer science student from the university of Haifa in Israel.

 I started being interested in cybersecurity around May of 2022 and learned basic knowledge doing [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/ "picoCTF.org") challenges and learning from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/ "OverTheWire/wargames") wargames too.

 I'm just a beginner in the field so if you're hoping to make friends and learn together I encourage you to send a messege!
